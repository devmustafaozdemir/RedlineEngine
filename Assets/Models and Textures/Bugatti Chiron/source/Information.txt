Hello dear user

There are some features in the model that should be mentioned:

1.The spoiler can move up and down, everything under it has been modeled

2.Rims have three textures which two of them are for the original color
and metalness and the other one (rims-masked) is for custom colored
rims. you can use that texture as a mask in order to have two different
colors for the rims.

3. Left turn light and right turn light are seperate so you can turn on 
them seperately

4. Doors are not attached to the body, if you want the doors and 
the body to be a single object, select both objects and press "ctrl + j"
in blender.
